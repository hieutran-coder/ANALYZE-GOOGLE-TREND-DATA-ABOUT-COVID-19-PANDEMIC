Hello, what your name?
I am going to implement Hadoop Cluster?
So do you want to see my doing?.

n the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem (2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular bins of width W and height H, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;

(ii) in the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP), we are further given a bin of width W and inﬁnite height (hereafter called strip), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.

In both cases, the items have to be packed with their w-edges parallel to the W-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that w j 6 W and h j 6 H (j ¼ 1; . . . ; n).

Both problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional) Bin Packing Problem (1BP), in which n items, each having an associated size h j , have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity H.

A third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item j has an associated proﬁt p j > 0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single ﬁnite bin, which maximizes the total selected proﬁt. This problem is usually denoted as (Two-Dimensional) Cutting
